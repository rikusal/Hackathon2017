# Hackathon2017
My contribution to the Digital Humanities Hackathon 2017

Contains three simplish snippets of code. ravintolakuvaustenPurku.py extracts restaurant descriptions and names from a large JSON-file. lemmatisaatio.py detects the language of the description (poorly) and lemmatizes it. Finally ravintolaTopics.R uses the stm-library to form a topic model from the restaurant descriptions.
